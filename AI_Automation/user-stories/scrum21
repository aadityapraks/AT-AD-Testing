As a registered and approved AP on the PwD Catalog Portal,
I want to view how my uploaded product details appear to PwD users on the catalog,
so that I can ensure that the information, images, video, and specifications are displayed correctly, are accessibility-compliant, and provide a clear understanding of the product’s features.
