📝 Accessibility Testing – Unified Test Plan (axe DevTools + JAWS) 

1. Objective 

To test the entire portal for WCAG 2.1 Level AA and Section 508 compliance using a single accessibility check that combines axe DevTools (automated) and JAWS (manual screen reader) validations. 

2. Test Approach – Single Accessibility Check 

For each page: 

Open page in Edge browser. 

Run axe DevTools: 

Scan for missing alt text, ARIA issues, low contrast, missing form labels, heading structure issues. 

Export results for documentation. 

Use JAWS screen reader: 

Validate reading order, alt text announcements, form labels, error messages, ARIA roles, dynamic content, keyboard-only navigation. 

Manual visual checks: 

Color contrast, captions for multimedia, consistent layout, plain language content. 

Log all issues in a single report with severity and WCAG references. 

Shape 

3. Expected Outcome 

One combined accessibility report per page. 

Both automated (axe) and manual (JAWS) issues documented together. 

Clear fix recommendations mapped to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
