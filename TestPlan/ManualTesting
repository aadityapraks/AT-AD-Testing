Manual Testing – Unified Test Plan (Cursor AI + Git)

1. Objective  
   - Manually validate critical business workflows, smoke scenarios, and regression coverage across major browsers to ensure stability and functional correctness.  
   - Author, review, and optimize test cases using Cursor AI with Git-backed traceability.

2. Manual Testing Approach  
   - Scope: critical end-to-end workflows, smoke per deployment, regression suites, basic negative checks, and cross-browser behavior validation.  
   - Test design: leverage Cursor AI for ideation and formatting; capture Preconditions, Steps, and Expected Outcomes; review collaboratively.  
   - Repository: store approved cases in Git (Markdown) for history and audits.  
   - Testing types covered: Smoke, Functional, Regression, Negative, UI/UX, and UI-driven integration validation.

3. Tools & Repository Management  
   - AI assistance: Cursor AI.  
   - Test case storage: Cursor AI workspace with Git sync.  
   - Version control: Git.  
   - Browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox.  
   - Documentation format: Markdown .

4. Test Data Strategy  
   - Use static and dynamic data sets for consistency.   
   - Reset/validate data before major regression cycles to prevent contamination.

5. Execution & Reporting  
   - Execute manually on target browsers/environments defined per release.  
   - Capture results in Git-tracked artifacts.  
   - Use Cursor AI summaries for quick status notes when needed.

6.Regression Testing
    - Tag based Regression testing will be executed before every new sprint release and prior to each production deployment.
    - The purpose is to ensure that new changes do not impact existing stable functionalities.

7. Expected Outcome  
   - High-quality, fully documented manual suite aligned with business priorities.  
   - Traceable test assets with AI-assisted design and faster reviews.  
   - Improved defect detection, lower production issues, and consistent reporting discipline.
