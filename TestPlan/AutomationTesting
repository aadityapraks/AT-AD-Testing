Automation Testing – Unified Test Plan (Playwright + TypeScript)

1. Objective  
   - Automate regression and critical business workflows using Playwright with JavaScript/TypeScript to ensure stable, repeatable, and fast validation of key functionalities across major browsers.

2. Automation Approach  
   - Identify high-priority automatable scenarios. 
   - Generate test cases using Cursor AI for faster and standardized coverage. 
   - Create Playwright test scripts.  
   - Execute suites across Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.  
   - Cover Smoke, Sanity, Regression, and basic Negative test cases.
   - Parallel execution of test case

3. Framework & Tooling  
   - Tool: Playwright  
   - Language: JavaScript/TypeScript  
   - Runner: Playwright Test Runner

4. Test Data Strategy  
   - Use static test data.  
   - Maintain pre-created users: Admin, Vendor.

5. Execution Environment  
   - Local machine.  
   - Browsers: Chrome, Edge, Firefox.

6. Reporting  
   - Playwright HTML reports.  
   - Defect logging in JIRA.

7. Entry & Exit Criteria  
   - Entry: Stable build and available test data.  
   - Exit: All critical tests executed.

8. Risks & Mitigation  
   - UI changes: rely on stable selectors.  
   - Data issues: keep well-defined static data.

9. Expected Outcome  
   - Stable automation framework.  
   - Faster regression testing.

10. Tag-Based Test Execution 

Test cases will be annotated with execution tags such as:

@smoke – for build validation
@regression – for full regression cycles
@negative – for negative scenarios
@module-name – for module-wise selective execution
